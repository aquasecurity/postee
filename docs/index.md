Postee is a simple message routing application that receives input messages through a webhook interface, and can take enforce actions using predefined outputs via integrations.

Primary use of Postee is to act as a message relay and notification service that integrates with a variety of third-party services. Postee can also be used for sending vulnerability scan results or audit alerts from Aqua Platform to collaboration systems.

In addition, Postee can also be used to enforce pre-defined behaviours that can orchestrate actions based on input messages as triggers.
